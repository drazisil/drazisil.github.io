Switching to a static site to see if it gets me writing more. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

Following [this example](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

Copied over a few old blog bosts. One of my old blogs has the posts in a very messy HTML format, so I didn't copy those. You can correctly find them at [blogger_backup-08-10-2019.xml](https://github.com/drazisil/drazisil.github.io/blob/master/blogger_backup-08-10-2019.xml)
